this is mostly the what-how of building an epically awesome infinity mirror.. the LED sparkly, heart-shaped kind... and one that can SEE YOU.. and when it sees you.. and I mean really sees you.. it captures that moment and passes it onto Twitter- *permissions notwithstanding 

also.. the fab instructions and detail twirly gigs of code should be up... if not.. let us know.

HEART MIRROR
HeartTron is an infinity mirror â€“ there are LED lights contained within reflective layers that create a dynamic effect of depth when turned on. HeartTron also 
contains a camera; when HeartTron sees two people.. it lights up and takes a photo - sending the image to a social feed
